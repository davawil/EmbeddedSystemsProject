The mini project for the Embedded Systems course 
# CMOS SENSOR CONFIGURATION
1. QSys: make sure the conduit of the camera controller is connected to the conduit of the cmos sensor
2. QSys: make sure that the input clock of the cmos sensor is connected to the CameraClock of the Camera Controller
3. assign the signals from the system instantiation hdl to the top-level vhdl
# CAMERA CONFIGURATION
1. QSys: make sure the conduit of the camera controller is exported
2. QSys: make sure that the CameraClock and the output reset of the Camera Controller are exported
3. assign the signals from the system instantiation hdl to the top-level vhdl
